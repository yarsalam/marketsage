## Release and capital-risk guardrails

- No data source currently passes the complete acceptance gate for investment scoring.
- Stage 4 remains exploratory; the 2023-10-31 through 2024-03-31 fold reporting +240.89% requires asset-level attribution from the exact original input dataset.
- Do not inspect or tune against the locked final holdout.
- A local Runner/checksum/workflow success does not approve a source, backtest, ranking, probability or investment recommendation.
- No production scoring, broker access, portfolio allocation or real-money trade is authorized. Any capital-risk action requires separate explicit owner approval.
